Shared across all applications:
- Severity levels and meaning
- Finding structure and terminology
- Table layouts for findings
- Filtering and sorting behavior
- Icons and visual language

Application-specific:
- Data sources
- Execution logic
- Automation workflows
- Permissions and access control
- Branding name and copy where appropriate

Rule:
If something feels shared, it is shared.
Default to goose-core.
